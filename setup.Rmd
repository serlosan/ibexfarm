When we access IbexFarm for the first time, we need to create a new experiment and come up with a name for it. Note that the name we choose is the name participants will see in the URL, so choose a name that does not give away too much information.

Within our experiment, there are many files grouped in different sections:

* **chunk_includes**: Includes the HTML file participants see when they open the experiment's link. Here we also include some questions to gather data from our participants (age, native language, etc.).
* **css_includes**: 
* **data_includes**: Includes the file containing the experimental sentences.
* **js_includes**: 
* **results**: When results are sent to the server, two files will appear here: "raw_results" and "results".
* **server_state**: Counter.

The files we must modify are included in **chunk_includes** (example_intro.html) and **data_includes** (example_data.js). These files are HTML and JavaScript, respectively. Even though IbexFarm includes an online editor, I recommend using a third part editor because IbexFarm does not support UTF-8, i.e. special characters like accents, ñ, or initial question marks (¿) will not be displayed. Please install [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
